## ðŸ›  How to Use
1. **View the Presentation**:
   - Download the PDF file [`BOM, DOM & JavaScript Workflow.pdf`] to explore the slides.
   - Use GitHub's built-in PDF viewer for quick access.

2. **For Developers**:
   - Refer to Slide 12 for a **practical code example** combining BOM and DOM.
   - Check Slide 13 for **best practices** to optimize your JavaScript code.

3. **For Learners**:
   - Focus on Slides 3â€“10 for foundational concepts.
   - Use Slide 16's **"Final Tip"** to experiment with DevTools.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters
- **BOM/DOM mastery** is crucial for front-end development.
- Understanding these concepts helps debug and optimize web apps.
- Modern frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) abstract these but rely on them internally.
